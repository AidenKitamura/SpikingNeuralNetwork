## Brain Inspired Computing Big Project
This project is a deep learning project for the course Brain Inspired Computing conducted at SUTD. In this project, the main purpose is to reproduce a model proposed in the paper: Fast-Classifying, High-Accuracy Spiking Deep Networks Through Weight and Threshold Balancing.
## File Structure
All code related to models are contained in the folder models. It is further divided into 3 sub-folders, including extractors, loaders, and predictors. The extractors are the backbones, the loaders are used to treat different dataset, and the predictors are used for different applications.

## External Sources
We used implementation from https://github.com/anglyan/spikingtorch for Spiking Net. Revisions were made according to demand.
## Usage
To be conpleted.
